# 🔄 Async Operations in Redux (Thunk)

## ❓ What Is This Topic About?

By default, **Redux works synchronously**.
That means reducers expect **immediate, plain-object actions**.

However, real-world applications need to:

- Call APIs
- Fetch data from servers (REST APIs, Firebase)
- Handle **loading** and **error** states

👉 **Redux Thunk** allows us to write **asynchronous logic** inside Redux.

## 1️⃣ Middleware Concept

### ✅ What Is Middleware?

**Middleware** is a layer that sits **between an action and a reducer**:

```text
Action  →  Middleware  →  Reducer
```

### 🔧 What Middleware Can Do

- Intercept actions
- Modify actions
- Delay actions
- Perform async operations (API calls)

---

## 🔄 Redux Without Middleware

```text
Component → dispatch(action) → reducer → store
```

Only **plain JavaScript objects** are allowed as actions:

```js
{
  type: "ADD_TASK";
}
```

❌ No async logic
❌ No functions allowed

---

## 🔄 Redux With Middleware (Thunk)

```text
Component → dispatch(function) → middleware → reducer
```

✅ Now we can dispatch **functions**, not just objects.

---

## 🧠 Why Do We Need Middleware?

Middleware is useful for:

- Logging actions
- Error handling
- Async API calls
- Authentication & authorization checks

---

## 2️⃣ Redux Thunk – Core Idea

### ✅ Definition

**Redux Thunk** is a middleware that allows **action creators to return a function instead of an object**.

---

### 🔹 Normal Action Creator (Synchronous)

```js
const addTask = (task) => ({
  type: "ADD_TASK",
  payload: task,
});
```

✔️ Returns an object
✔️ Executes immediately

---

### 🔹 Thunk Action Creator (Asynchronous)

```js
const fetchTasks = () => {
  return (dispatch) => {
    // async logic here
  };
};
```

✔️ Returns a function
✔️ Can perform API calls
✔️ Can dispatch multiple actions

---

### ✨ Key Rule of Redux Thunk

Thunk provides access to:

```js
dispatch, getState;
```

This allows you to:

- Dispatch multiple actions
- Read current store state
- Wait for API responses before updating the store

---

## 3️⃣ Async API Calls Using Redux Thunk

### 🔁 Typical Async Flow

```text
1. Dispatch REQUEST action
2. Call API
3. Dispatch SUCCESS or FAILURE action
```

---

### 📊 Example Action Flow

```text
FETCH_TASKS_REQUEST  → loading = true
FETCH_TASKS_SUCCESS  → data stored
FETCH_TASKS_FAILURE  → error stored
```

This pattern helps manage:

- Loading states
- Error handling
- Clean UI updates

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **Redux Thunk enables async logic in Redux by allowing functions to be dispatched**

It is essential for:

- API calls
- Data fetching
- Real-world application behavior
