### Question 1: What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples.

**Arithmetic operators:** `+ , - , * , / , % , ++ , -- , **`

- Arithmetic operators in JavaScript are used to perform mathematical calculations on numbers or variables such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, Exponentiation and more.

Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers .
The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.

**Assignment operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`  
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

**Comparison operators:** `==`, `===`, `!=`, `>`

- Comparison operators is used to compare two values or expressions. They return a Boolean value — true or false — based on whether the comparison condition is satisfied.
- They are commonly used in conditional statements like if, while, and loops to make decisions in the program.

**Logical operators:** `&&`, `||`, `!`

- Logical operators is used to combine or compare multiple conditions and return a Boolean value (true or false).
- They are commonly used in decision-making statements like if, while, and loops.

**Spread operators:** The `...` operator splits iterables into individual elements.
The spread operator expands an iterable into a list of individual elements, while the rest parameter gathers a variable number of arguments into a single array. The latter is used to define functions with a variable number of parameters.

### Question 2: What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

- Are the comparison operators.
- `==` compares values after type conversion.
- `===` compares values **and** types (strict equality).
