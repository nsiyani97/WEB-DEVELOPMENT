## 🏷️ What Is a Markup Language?

A **Markup Language** defines **how content is structured and interpreted**, not just how it looks.

### ✍️ Simple Analogy

In normal English writing:

- Quotation marks — **“like this”** — indicate quoted text

In HTML:

- **Tags** are used to describe the **role and meaning** of content

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```

- `<h1>` tells the browser that the text is a **main heading**
- It defines structure and importance, not just visual style

## 🧠 Key Concept

> **HTML focuses on structure and meaning**

- **HTML** → Structure & content
- **CSS** → Design & appearance
- **JavaScript** → Interaction & behavior

---

## 🏁 Summary

HTML allows us to:

- Structure web content
- Connect documents using hyperlinks
- Build the foundation of all websites

Without HTML, the web **would not exist in its current form**.
