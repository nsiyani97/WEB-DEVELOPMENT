# 🌐 Internet – How It Works

The **internet** is a **global network of interconnected computers and devices** that allows information sharing across the world.

It enables:

- Web browsing
- Emails
- Video & music streaming
- Online communication
- Access to digital services and resources

In simple words, the internet acts as a **worldwide infrastructure** for online connectivity.

## 🔁 What Happens When You Open a Website?

---

## 1️⃣ You Type a Website Name

Example:

```text
google.com
```

This is a **human-friendly name**, not something computers directly understand.

---

## 2️⃣ DNS Finds the IP Address

- Computers communicate using **numbers**, called **IP addresses**
- DNS (**Domain Name System**) converts names into IPs

Example:

```text
google.com → 142.250.xx.xx
```

## 3️⃣ Your Device Sends a Request to the Router

- Phone / Laptop
  ⬇️
- Wi-Fi Router

The router acts as a **gateway** between your device and the internet.

---

## 4️⃣ Router Sends the Request to Your ISP

Your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** carries your request forward.

Examples:

- Jio
- Airtel
- BSNL

---

## 5️⃣ Request Travels Through Many Routers

- The request hops through **multiple routers and networks**
- It may cross **cities, countries, and oceans**

🌍 Global underwater cables make this possible:

## 6️⃣ Request Reaches the Website Server

- A **server** is a powerful computer
- It stores:

  - Website files
  - Databases
  - APIs
  - Media content

---

## 7️⃣ Server Sends Data Back

The server responds with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Images & videos
- API data

---

## 8️⃣ Browser Displays the Webpage

Your browser:

- Reads HTML → builds structure
- Applies CSS → adds design
- Runs JavaScript → enables interaction
- Loads media → shows final page

🎉 You see the website on your screen.
