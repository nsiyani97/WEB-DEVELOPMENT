# 🌍 How a Website Works

## 1️⃣ Website Files Are Created by Developers

Websites are **built by developers** using different technologies.

📌 **First website ever created:**

### 🧱 Technologies Used to Build a Website

- **HTML** → Structure (headings, text, layout)
- **CSS** → Design (colors, fonts, responsiveness)
- **JavaScript** → Interaction (buttons, forms, animations)
- **Backend (optional)** → Logic (login, APIs, authentication)
- **Database** → Stores data (users, products, messages, orders)

---

## 2️⃣ Files Are Uploaded to a Server

After development, all website files are **uploaded to a server**.

### 🖥️ Types of Hosting Platforms

- **Shared Hosting** → Hostinger, GoDaddy
- **Cloud Hosting** → AWS, Google Cloud
- **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** → DigitalOcean
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** → Cloudflare

📌 The server is **always ON (24/7)** so users can access the site anytime.

---

## 3️⃣ Server Gets a Domain Name

- Example: `mywebsite.com`
- The **domain name** is connected to the **server’s IP address**
- This allows users to access the site using an easy-to-remember name instead of numbers

---

## 4️⃣ User Requests the Website

When a user types a website URL in the browser:

➡️ **Browser sends a request** to the server

---

## 5️⃣ Server Sends Required Files

The server responds by sending:

- HTML files
- CSS files
- JavaScript files
- Images & videos
- API data (if needed)

---

## 6️⃣ Browser Builds the Webpage

The browser processes everything step by step:

- 📄 **Reads HTML** → Creates page structure
- 🎨 **Applies CSS** → Adds colors and design
- ⚙️ **Runs JavaScript** → Enables interaction (login, buttons, animations)
- 🖼️ **Loads images & videos** → Displays final content

---

## 7️⃣ User Interacts with the Website

Users can:

- Click buttons
- Fill forms
- Login or sign up
- Buy products
- Watch videos

👉 These actions are handled by **JavaScript + Backend + Database**

---

## 🔁 Website Flow (In Short)

```text
Developer builds website
        ↓
Upload files to server
        ↓
User requests website
        ↓
Server sends files
        ↓
Browser displays webpage
```

---

## 🏁 Final Key Idea

> **Websites work on a request–response model**

Understanding this flow is **fundamental** for frontend, backend, and full-stack development.
