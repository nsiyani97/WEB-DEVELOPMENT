- What is JavaScript?
  JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted scripting language used mainly
  to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

- Types of JavaScript
  Refers to JavaScript versions or usage environments like Vanilla JS,
  Node.js (server-side), and frameworks built on JS.

- let, var & const
  var → function-scoped, redeclarable.
  let → block-scoped, no redeclaration.
  const → block-scoped, constant reference.

- Operators
  Used to perform operations (arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignment).

- Conditions: if / else-if / nested-if
  Used to execute code based on conditions.

- Switch
  Alternative to multiple if-else, checks multiple cases.

- Loops: while, do-while, for
  Used to run code repeatedly until a condition fails.

- Array
  Ordered collection of elements.

- for-of & for-in loops
  for-of → iterate over values.
  for-in → iterate over keys.

- Array Functions
  Common built‑ins like push, pop, shift, unshift, splice.

- String Functions
  Built‑ins like length, slice, substring, trim, includes.

- User Defined Functions (UDF) -- 4 Types
  No argument, no return
  With argument, no return
  No argument, with return
  With argument, with return

- Arrow Function
  Shorter syntax function with lexical `this`.

- High Order Function (HOF)
  A function that accepts another function as argument or returns a
  function.

- map / filter (Advanced Functions)
  map → transforms each item, returns new array.
  filter → returns items meeting a condition.

- Spread / Merge / Destructure / Rest
  Spreading - Expands array or object (`...arr`).
  Merging - Combines arrays/objects using spread.
  Destructuring - Extracting values from arrays/objects into variables.
  Rest Operator - Collects remaining items into an array (`...rest`).

- Objects
  Object - Key-value data structure.
  Object Destructuring - Extract properties into variables.

- getter → read property.
- setter → update property.

- DOM (Document Object Model) - Structure to access/manipulate HTML elements.
- BOM (Browser Object Model) - Browser features like window, location.

- setTimeout → runs function once after delay.
- setInterval → repeats function at intervals.

- eventListener - Used to handle user actions like click, input.

- Error Handling
  Exception Handling - Manages runtime errors.

- try / catch / finally
  try → code to test.
  catch → handles errors.
  finally → always runs.

- Callback → Promise → Async/Await
  Callback - Function passed into another function.
  Callback Hell - Too many nested callbacks causing unreadable code.
  Promises - Handles async operations with `.then()` and `.catch()`.
  async – Marks a function as asynchronous and ensures it always returns a Promise.
  await – Pauses the execution inside an async function until a Promise is resolved or rejected.

- LocalStorage CRUD
  setItem() Stores data.
  getItem() Gets stored data.
  removeItem() Removes a specific key.
  clear() Removes all data.

- Validation (RegExp)
  RegExp test() - Checks whether a pattern matches a string, returns true/false.

- OOP in JavaScript
  Class & Object - Class is a template; object is an instance of the class.
  Inheritance - One class inherits properties/methods of another.
  Polymorphism - Same method name behaves differently in different contexts.
  Data Abstraction → hiding complexity.
  Data Encapsulation → protecting data using private fields.

- Constructor (Default & Parameterized)
  Default → no arguments.
  Parameterized → accepts arguments.

- super Keyword - Used to call the parent class constructor or methods.

- this Keyword - Refers to the current object context.
