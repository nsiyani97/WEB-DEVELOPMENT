JavaScript is the language that powers the web.

Netscape Navigator was a popular browser in the 1990s and one of the first widely used ones. Before Netscape, the first browser was Mosaic.

A browser sends a request for data to a server, and the server sends the data back to the browser.

To make websites more dynamic with animations and real-time interaction servers can not respond instantly to every user action. For that, a scripting language was needed to add functionality to websites.

Brendan Eich created JavaScript in just 10 days. When it was first made, it was called LiveScript. Later, Microsoft reverse-engineered it and made their own version called JScript. These small differences caused confusion, so Europeans standardized the language as ECMAScript (ECMA is the organization’s name). That’s why we now see different versions of ECMAScript.

In JavaScript, “script” refers to giving step-by-step instructions on how elements should work — like first say hello, then greet good morning.

The “Java” in JavaScript does not refer to the Java programming language. JavaScript is an interpreted language, while Java is a compiled language. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C5AHaS1mOA

To give instruction to computer has to be translated by interpreter and compiler.

interpreted : JavaScript, Python, Ruby
compiled : Java, C/C++, Swift

javascript is the one language that is supported by all major browsers like Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Opera
