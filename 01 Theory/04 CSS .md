# 🎨 CSS – Cascading Style Sheets

**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**.
It is used to control the **visual appearance** of web pages.

---

## 🌊 What Does “Cascading” Mean?

The word **cascade** means _flowing downward_, like a **waterfall**.

In CSS:

- Styles are applied in a **specific order**
- Multiple rules can apply to the same element
- If there is a conflict, the rule **lower in the cascade** (closer to the element) usually wins

👉 This system helps decide **which style gets priority**.

---

## 🧾 What Are “Style Sheets”?

**Style Sheets** define **how elements should look** on a website, including:

- Colors
- Fonts
- Spacing
- Layout

CSS separates **design from HTML structure**, making websites easier to manage.

## 🧩 Types of Style Sheet Languages

Apart from plain CSS, there are **CSS preprocessors** that extend CSS features:

- **Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)**
  Adds variables, nesting, mixins, and better organization.

- **LESS (Leaner CSS)**
  Similar to Sass, with reusable styles and cleaner syntax.

These tools make styling **more powerful and maintainable**.

## 📜 Historical Background

- In **January 1997**, **HTML 3.2** was introduced
- It included **presentational HTML tags**, such as:

  - `<font>` → for font size, color, and font family
  - `<center>` → for centering content

---

## ⚠️ Why These Tags Were Deprecated

The `<font>` and `<center>` tags are now **deprecated**, meaning they should **not** be used in modern HTML.

### ❌ Reasons for Deprecation

- They **mixed design with HTML structure**
- HTML should focus on **content and structure**
- Styling should be handled by **CSS**

### ✅ Advantages of Using CSS

- Better **flexibility**
- Improved **reusability**
- Easier **maintenance**
- Cleaner and more semantic HTML

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **HTML defines structure, CSS defines appearance**

This separation is a core principle of **modern web development**.
