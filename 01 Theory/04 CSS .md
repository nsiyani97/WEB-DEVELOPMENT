CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

**Cascading** — cascade is simply like a waterfall; you have water at one level, then it drops down through the waterfall into another level.  
Similarly, CSS also follows a flow where styles are applied in a sequence. If two styles conflict, the one lower in the cascade (closer to the element) takes priority.

**Style Sheets** — it allows us to specify how things should look on a website.  
There are also many types of style sheet languages like:

- **Sass** : Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
- **LESS** : Leaner CSS (a CSS preprocessor)

- In **January 1997**, W3C introduced **HTML 3.2**, which came with new presentational tags like `<font>`, `<center>`, etc.

- The `<font>` tag was used to define font size, color, and font face for its content.
- The `<center>` tag was used to center text or content on the screen.

- But these tags are deprecated, meaning they are no longer recommended and should not be used in modern HTML.

Reason for deprecation is:

- They mixed design with HTML structure.
- Styling should be handled by CSS, not HTML tags.
- CSS provides more flexibility, reusability, and easier maintenance.
