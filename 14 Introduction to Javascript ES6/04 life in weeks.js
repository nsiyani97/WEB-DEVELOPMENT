// Life in Weeks Coding Exercise
// I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

// In this challenge, you are going to create a function that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

// It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format:

// You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

// Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

// For this challenge, assume there are 365 days in a year, 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year.

// IMPORTANT your console.log output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

// Example Input
// e.g. If you are 56 years old:
// lifeInWeeks(56)

// Example Output
// You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
