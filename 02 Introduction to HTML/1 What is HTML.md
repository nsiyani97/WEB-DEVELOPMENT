HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

**HyperText** refers to text that can link one document to another webpage.
These linked pieces of text are called hypertext or hyperlinks, and they form the core foundation of how HTML-based websites work.

**Markup Language** defines how text should appear.
For example, in English writing, quotation marks — “like this” — tell the reader that a specific part of the text is a quotation.
In the same way, HTML uses markup (tags) to describe the structure and meaning of content on a webpage.
