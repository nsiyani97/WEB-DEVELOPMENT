1. Website files are created by developers

A website is built using:

HTML → structure

CSS → design

JavaScript → interaction

Backend (optional) → database, login, API, etc.

Database → stores user info, products, messages etc.

2. Files are uploaded to a server

Developers host the website on:

Hosting (Hostinger, GoDaddy)

Cloud (AWS, Google Cloud)

VPS (DigitalOcean)

CDN (Cloudflare)

This server is always ON.

3. Server gets a domain

Example: mywebsite.com
Domain connects to the server’s IP.

4. User requests the website

When someone visits the site:
Browser sends a request → server.

5. Server sends back required files

HTML, CSS, JS, images, API data, etc.

6. Browser builds the webpage

Reads HTML → makes structure

Reads CSS → adds colors, design

Runs JavaScript → adds buttons, animations, login, etc.

Loads Images/Videos → final page displayed

7. User interacts with the site

Click buttons, fill forms, buy products, login, play videos — everything handled by scripts + backend + database.

👉 In short:
Developer builds → Upload to server → User requests → Server sends → Browser displays
