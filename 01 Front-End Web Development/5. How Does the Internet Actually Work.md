1. You type a website name

Example: google.com

2. DNS finds the IP address

Internet doesn’t understand names → it uses numbers (IP address).
DNS tells your device:
👉 “google.com = 142.250.xx.xx”

3. Your device sends request to your Wi-Fi router

Your phone/laptop → Router.

4. Router sends it to your Internet Provider (ISP)

Jio / Airtel / BSNL etc.

5. The request travels through many routers

It keeps jumping through many networks across cities/countries.

6. It reaches the server of the website

This is a powerful computer storing all website data.

7. Server sends back the information

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, data, etc.

8. Your browser receives and displays it

You see the webpage.

👉 In short:
Name → Address → Send → Server → Back → Display
