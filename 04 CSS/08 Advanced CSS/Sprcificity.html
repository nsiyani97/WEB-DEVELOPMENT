    <!-- ** Specificity is the way which helps the browsers to decide which property value is most relevant for the element. It determines which style declaration is applied to an element. **
     * The CSS specificity is important only when various selectors are affecting the same element. In this case, the browser needs a way to identify the style to be applied to the matching element, and CSS specificity is the way of doing it.
     * When two or more selectors have equal specificity value, then the latest one considers.
     * Universal selectors (*) and the inherited values have lower specificity, i.e., 0 specificity.
     * The style property has a greater specificity value compare to the selectors (except the !important in the stylesheet selector).
     * The !important alter the selector specificity. When two selectors have equal specificity. then the selector having !important -->

    <!-- ** hierarchy ** -->
    <!-- *1. inline styles : It is attached to the element which is to be styled. For example: <p style="color:red;">. It has the highest priority.
        *2. IDs : It is unique identifier for the elements of a page that has the second-highest priority. For example: #para.
        *3. Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes : It includes classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes(like :focus, :hover, etc.).
        *4. Elements and pseudo-elements : It includes the name of elements (div,h1) and pseudo-elements (like :after and :before). They have the lowest priority. -->

    <!-- ** Rules ** -->
    <!-- * The specificity of ID selectors is higher than attribute selectors
      * In equal specificity, the latest rule will count
      * The specificity of class selector is greater than the element selectors -->
